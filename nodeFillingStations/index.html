	<h1>Alternative Fuel Filling Stations</h1>
	
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>With electric cars becoming cheaper more ubiqutous the excuses for driving one with an internal combustion engine are dwindeling. One major hurdle however, is availability of places to "fill up" your car. Driving 500 miles to see family doesn't work too well if your car has a 150 mile range and the only charging station is in your garage. <br><br>
		I got interested to look at electric charging stations, and before I knew it I had found a dataset with not just electric charging stations around the country, but all filling stations for alternative fuels. <br><br>
		Be patient, it is <strong>slow</strong>; your browswer is rendering 18,600 individual datapoints, pretty impressive. 
		Let me know what you think on twitter (<strong><a href = "https://twitter.com/NicholasStrayer">@Nicholas Strayer</a></strong>) or by email (<strong>nstrayer [at] uvm [dot] edu</strong>. <br><br>
