      "\n",
      "## Summary: \n",
      "1. Get data in the form you want. Organized as an array/listof js objects. Cleaned, as trim as possible and with lat lon info. \n",
      "2. Choose the style vis you want (currently node or hexbined heatmap. \n",
      "3. Make sure the names of the statistic you are using (if more than just location) is properly named in the code. \n",
      "4. Add interaction if wanted (mouseover, mouseout, click)\n",
      "5. Profit...\n",

      "##Things of note: \n",
      "\n",
      "###Data format: \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently the webthing implimentation takes data in the form of a javascript object shoved in its own seperate .js file called in the html, this avoids asynchronicity and also I can't figure out how to access csvs. I use [this](http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm) to convert data to the right format, then copy and paste into the .js file.\n",
      "\n",

      "D3 is a lon lat kinda gal. (x,y) $\\Longleftrightarrow$ (lon,lat). Remember this order and you're golden. \n",
      "\n",
      "###Data Labeling: \n",
      "You can label location info \"lon\" \"lat\" for the node based visualizations, but for the hexbins, due to a need from the d3.hexbin library, they need to be [0] for lon [1] for lat. \n",
      "(This is because you feed d3.hexbin() an array with lon lat in it, it expects a simple array of arrays so it calls array[i][0], array[i+1][0] etc. In case you were wondering. \n",
      "\n",
      "### More than just location?\n",
      "If your data has more variables than simply location you should label that whatever you need. Stat is a useful name if there is a single value. \n",
      "\n",
      "###Need to grab lat lons from addresses, landmarks etc?\n",
      "Use this handi-dandy geocoding function. You should probably use [Charles' superior version](https://bitbucket.org/sbmct/sluice-demo-telecon/src/680e23d703803950c6b53689d0c253ac4ed4def3/lib/python/telecon/geo_lookup.py?at=feature/phase3) though..."
